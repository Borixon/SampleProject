This is simple project created by "Michał Krupa Aplikacje Mobilne" as a sample of code.

In order to run the project you need to have computer with macOS system and latest XCode (at least version number 11.0). 
Open the project by clicking on HSBC.xcodeproj file. 
Click on HSBC icon in project navigator, choose signing and capabilities and add any team that fits. 
Navigate to top left corner and choose device or simulator to run and press cmd+r or click on right rotated triangle.

Application does not have any data downloaded yet. In order to do this you can drag table view cell down and hold for short period of time. Now data should be downloaded and application is ready to explore. By clicking any visible item you can see deatils of the city. You can click on bottom screen button to open modal screen with map view.

There is much functionalities that might be added in future.
Main assumption is that you can't remove any of the cities from Core Data so this is not yet implemented! Adding city with already existing ID might overwrite previous one.
Also caching of images is not implemented as well as adding to favourite flag.
